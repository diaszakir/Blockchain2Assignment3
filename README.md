# ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¿ AI Assistant for the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan

## Overview

This project is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of an AI Assistant designed to answer questions related to the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases to provide accurate and context-aware responses.

## Features

* **Chat Interface**: Interactive chat powered by Streamlit.
* **LLM Integration**: Utilizes model - Ollama - for natural language understanding.
* **Document Upload**: Users can upload one or multiple documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
* **Contextual Q\&A**: Answers questions based on the uploaded documents and the Constitution.
* **Vector Store**: Stores queries and answers using MongoDB for efficient retrieval.
